# Modeling
Modeling techniques including Machine Learning, Deep Learning

# Universal Function
- ["Evaluation.py"](https://github.com/xup6YJ/Modeling/blob/main/Code/Evaluation.py) for outputting prediction result including Confusion Matrix, ROCurve, Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, NPV, F1-Score(used by all of the modeling source code).
- To build different kinds of model in basic including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, DNN, RNN by using ["Model.py"](https://github.com/xup6YJ/Modeling/blob/main/Code/Model.py).
- Basic data feature engineering and spliting data into Train/Test by using ["DataPreprocessing.py"](https://github.com/xup6YJ/Modeling/blob/main/Code/DataPreprocessing.py).
